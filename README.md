## Description
LibraLink is an advanced attendance system integrated with a book recommendation feature, specifically designed for library environments. At its core lies a robust facial recognition-based attendance mechanism, powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In addition to tracking attendance, the system offers a personalized book recommendation service, leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to align with user preferences.

## Key Features
Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System: Utilizes advanced CNN models for accurate and efficient attendance tracking through face recognition.
Book Recommendations with KNN: An intelligent recommendation system using the KNN algorithm to provide book suggestions that align with user interests.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and easy-to-use interface, facilitating effortless interaction with both the attendance and recommendation features.
## Technologies Used
- Primary Feature: Facial Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Supplementary Feature: Book Recommendation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Programming Language: Python
- GUI Framework: Tkinter
- Data Processing and Management: Pandas, NumPy
